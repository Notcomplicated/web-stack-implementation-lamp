# web-stack-implementation

Howdy ya'll and welcome to my first Web Stack Implementation project!

What is a Web Stack? It is is a group of software components, used to implement or set up various applications (for example, a website). The "stack" refers to the specific layered components (e.g. OS system, webserver, script interpreter, and database) which are built on top of each other. One of the most popular web stacks include LAMP, which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP or Python or Perl. The LAMP stack will be used for this project!

# LINUX

## Setting up your virtual environment

Linux is an operating system (OS) just like Windows, iOS, and Android. It is the best known and most used open source operating system in the world. It is flexible and easy to configure.

In order to complete this project, it is necessary to set up a virtual environment. In order to achieve this, first, create a free [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/) and then create a virtual machine (VM) using the Ubuntu Server OS. More details in the following section!

You may be wondering, 'what is Azure'? Azures is a cloud service provided by Microsoft. One the leading Cloud Service Providers in the world. Azure offers a wide variety of databases and services for different types of applications. This allows users to choose the right tool for the job while receiving the best cost and performance.

Azure offers a Free Trial for newly registered account users. This enables users to try out some Azure services free of charge over certain period. For this project, we will utilize the [Azure VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/overview) service, which is covered by the Free Trial version!

**Let's get started!**

Begin by registering and setting up an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/) and following the directions on the screen. Once you have created your AWS account, navigate to the login page and type in your credentials.

Once you've signed into the Azure portal, we would need to creat and provision a new VM. There are a few ways to go about it. you can use the create a resource (plus sign) or, finding the Virtual using Quick search or clicking home and finding the virtual machine blade.

In this instance I will click Virtual machines directly from the Azure services page. 

This will take me to the next page to create a new VM. Here, I will click create and select Virtual machine from the dropdown options.
